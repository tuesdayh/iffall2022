        <p>1. My name is Tuesday, my major is communication design, and im a Junior.</p>
        <p>2. I took this class because it is a major requirement and I would like to learn more about computer science and how it can be a tool in art.</p>
        <p>3. I dont have any experience in HTML, CSS, or JS but I have used Java.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to become more familiar with what goes into the creation of a well designed website
        <p>5. I expect there to be a steep learning curve as compared to other mediums and even digital programs</p>
        <p>6 I chose the<a href="https://www.mubasic.com">mubasic</a> website because it has a pleasing color palate and the mouse interaction is fluid and intuitive. </p>
        <p>7. I think <a href= "https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/?utm_source=us-en_brand_contextual-desktop_text&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_us_performancemarketing_core_brand+contextual-desktop+text+exact+us-en+google&gclid=CjwKCAjwvNaYBhA3EiwACgndgjOQsPXQp2_gCQN0MQT98f4QNubXS6sbQcuiJ7IvUMco6Bt-XZ-mYxoCxroQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.dsspotify">spotify</a> does a good job at displaying a lot of information without leaving the viewer overwhelmed. </p>
        <p>8. I think <a href= "https://workstack.io/">spotify</a>does a good job at organizing the information and directing the viewer to what they need to see (features, pricing, etc.)</p>
