            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In D&D, each player creates a heroic character to represent them in the game: this might be a skilled fighter, a devout cleric, a deadly rogue, a spellcasting wizard, or something else entirely!

                Together, the Dungeon Master (or DM) and players create an exciting story where their bold adventurers confront deadly perils. Even if the group doesn’t complete the adventure successfully, the good time and memories make everyone a winner.
            </p>
            <h2>Dungeon Masters</h2>
            <p>
                In Dungeons & Dragons, one person serves as the Dungeon Master (or "DM"), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM runs the adventure for the players, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.<br>

                Dungeons & DragonsThe DM describes the locations and creatures in an adventure, and the players decide what they want their characters to do. Then the DM, using imagination and the game's rules, determine the results of their actions and narrates what they experience.<br>

                Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.
