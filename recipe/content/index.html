        </p>
        <h3>Crust Ingredients: </h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups (325 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt or use 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar, optional</li>
            <li>1 cup (230 grams) very cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (2 sticks)</li>
            <li>4 to 8 tablespoons ice water</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        
        <h3>Filling Instructions:</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Peel, core and slice the apples. </li>
            
         <li>Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400°F.</li>   
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon    juice until well combined and set aside.</li> 
         <li>Remove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick, Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate.</li>
              <li> Spoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl. Spread the apple slices evenly. <li>
              <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling. Use a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in.</li>
              <li> Place the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust. In order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38" long) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise. Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a "pie shield".</li> 
              <li>Bake the pie at 400°F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375°F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes. You'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan.</li>
       </ol> 

        
       <h3>Crust Instructions:</h3>
       <ol>

         <li>Add 1 1/2 cups flour, salt and sugar (optional) to a medium bowl. Stir 2 to 3 times until combined.</li>
         <li>Scatter butter cubes over flour and mix briefly with a fork or spatula to coat the butter with flour.</li>
         <li>Cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender, working mixture until the flour has a coarse, mealy texture similar to fresh bread crumbs. About 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
         <li>Add remaining 1 cup of flour. Work butter and flour with the pastry blender until flour is evenly distributed. About 20 seconds. (Dough should look crumbly with pea-sized pieces).</li>
         <li>Sprinkle ice water over the mixture — start with 4 tablespoons and add from there. Using a rubber spatula, press the dough into itself. The crumbs should begin to form larger clusters. If you pinch some of the dough and it holds together, it’s ready. If the dough falls apart, add 2 to 4 more tablespoons of water and continue to press until dough comes together.</li>
         <li>Remove dough from bowl and place in a mound on a clean surface. Work the dough just enough to form a ball. Cut ball in half then form each half into discs. Wrap each disc with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months (just thaw it overnight in the fridge before using).</li>
         <li>
            Remove one of the dough discs from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.</li>
         <li>Lightly flour work surface, top of dough and rolling pin. Then use rolling pin to roll out dough to a 12-inch circle (about 1/8-inch thick). Be sure to check if the dough is sticking to the surface below — add a small amount of flour when necessary.</li>
         <li>Check for size by inverting pie dish over dough round. Look for a 1-inch edge around the pie dish. To transfer dough to dish, starting at one end, roll dough around rolling pin then unroll over dish.</li>
         <li>Gently press dough down into dish so that it lines the bottom and sides of the dish. (Be careful not to pull or stretch the dough). Then, use a knife or pair of kitchen scissors to trim dough to within 1/2-inch of the edge of the dish.</li>
         <li>Fold edge of dough underneath itself so that it creates a thicker, 1/4-inch border that rests on the lip of the dish. Then, crimp edges by pressing the pointer finger of one hand against the edge of the dough from the inside of the dish while gently pressing with two knuckles of the other hand from the outside. Refrigerate dough at least 20 minutes or freeze for 5 minutes before baking.</li>
         <li>Heat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a baking sheet on a middle oven rack.</li>
         <li>Place pie crust onto preheated baking sheet and reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F. Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until the crust is golden.</li>
