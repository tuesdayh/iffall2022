        <p>Someday, I'm gonna live</p>
        <p>In your house up on the hill</p>
        <p>And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing</p>
        <p>I'll plant a garden in the yard then</p>
        <p>They're gluing roses on a flatbed</p>
        <p>You should see it, I mean thousands</p>
        <p>I grew up here 'til it all went up in flames</p>
        <p>Except the notches in the door frame</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't know when you got taller</p>
        <p>See our reflection in the water</p>
        <p>Off a bridge at the Huntington</p>
        <p>I hopped the fence when I was 17</p>
        <p>Then I knew what I wanted</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up</p>
        <p>From my phone and see my life</p>
        <p>And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream</p>
        <p>I'm at the movies</p>
        <p>I don't remember what I'm seeing</p>
        <p>The screen turns into a tidal wave</p>
        <p>Then it's a dorm room like a hedge maze</p>
        <p>And when I find you</p>
        <p>You touch my leg, and I insist</p>
        <p>But I wake up before we do it</p>
        <br>
        <p>I don't know how, but I'm taller</p>
        <p>It must be something in the water</p>
        <p>Everything's growing in our garden</p>
        <p>You don't have to know that it's haunted</p>
        <br>
        <p>The doctor put her hands over my liver</p>
        <p>She told me my resentment's getting smaller</p>
        <p>No, I'm not afraid of hard work</p>
        <p>I get everything I want</p>
        <p>I have everything I wanted</p>
        <br> <br>
